	<h1>Retrospective Write Up</h1>

	This is the retrospective write up for Bits Please Project 1 - Minesweeper. The Minesweeper project was created by Zachary Atkins,
	Gage Phillips, Jacob Marshall, and Thomas Gartman. This document exists to meet requirements for EECS 448.

	<h2>Challenges Faced by the Team</h2>
		<div style = "margin-left: 40px">
			<p>This section lists a few challenges we faced as a team and how we overcame those challenges.</p>
			<h3>Git Issues</h3>
				<p style="margin-left: 20px">None of the team members described themselves as proficient with Git/Guthub before we started, so the team experienced
					issues with the version control service. Most of these issues were easily resolved (like remembering to commit <em>and</em> push); however, one
					problem took a large amount of time to resolve. Most of the team used Github Desktop on Windows, which we suspect as causing an issue where
					two versions of the same folder existed - "<b>M</b>inesweeper" and "<b>m</b>inesweeper". Our files were split between the two folders, yet the game
					still ran! After spending some time trying to debug, we just reverted to a previous commit.
				</p>
			<h3>Differences in Knowledge of Python and pygame</h3>
				<p style="margin-left: 20px">Two of our team members, specifically Zachary and Gage, had previous experience with Python. The other two members, Jacob
					and Thomas, had extremely little Python experience before starting this project. This limited how the tasks could be split between members and caused
					some confusion in interpreting code that developers wrote. While the learning curve for Python was not extremely steep, it did create a barrier to who
					could create what parts of the Minesweeper code.

					Zachary was the only team member at the start of the project who had experience with the pygame library. This meant he was forced to work on front end
					development while the rest of us focused on backend development. Additionally, this caused our structure to change as Zachary continued to create the
					front end. See <a href = "#StructChanges">Additional Planning to Avoid Structural Changes</a>.</p>


		</div>
	<h2>Features Cut from Demo</h2>
		<div style="margin-left: 40px">
			<p>This section focuses on features we wish we could implement but simply ran out of time to achieve. A description of all features is included.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Intense Mode - Additional Challenges while playing minesweeper to break user concentration. This included rock music, shaking the screen,
					and animals that would walk on the screen.</li>
				<li>Number Selectors - Being able to increment the number of mines/board size by more than 1 at a time.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>

	<h2>What the Team Would Have Done Differently</h2>
		<div style="margin-left: 40px">
			<p>In this section, we detail some things we would have done differently given the opportunity.</p>
			<h3 id="StructChanges">Additional Planning to Avoid Structural Changes</h3>
				<p style="margin-left: 20px">As we developed the back and front ends, our vision of the structure continually changed. Since we decided to use the pygame library,
					our plans were based off of our understanding of that library's functionality. As we learned more about how pygame functioned, our structure
					necessarily changed as a result. We should have spend some time playing around with pygame and understanding how it operates before starting
					our development cycle. The changes to the front-end structure necessitated changes to the back-end structure and overall slowed down development.
					When we decided to use 3rd-party libraries in the future, we will spend time undergoing tutorials and tests before implementing a code structure.
				</p>
			<h3>Documentation of Code</h3>
				<p style="margin-left: 20px">Due to different autodocumentation options that are available for Python, it took some time before we could implement
					standardized docstrings for Python. This caused to some confusion as different developers on the team interpreted code differently. This cause
					work to be repeated and methods to be implemented incorrectly. With the benefit of hindsight, we ought to have written some kind of documentation
					for functions as we developed. Then, we could have gone back and implemented the reST syntax on our documentation. In the future, our team will
					document while coding.
				</p>
			<h3>Standup Meetings</h3>
				<p style="margin-left: 20px">During the beginning of meetings, we spent some time discussing and dividing work between the group. Unfortuately,
					we then spent the remainder of meetings working without reuniting with the entire group to discuss what had been accomplished. This caused
					team members to work independently of each other and the spread of work to be uneven. We now plan on having quick standup planning session
					within our larger meetings.
