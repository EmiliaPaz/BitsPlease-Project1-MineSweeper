<h2>Challenges Faced by the Team</h2>

<h2>Features Cut from Demo</h2>

<h2>What the Team Would Have Done Differently</h2>
	<div style="margin-left: 40px">
		<h3>Additional Planning to Avoid Structural Changes</h3>
			<p style="margin-left: 20px">As we developed the back and front ends, our vision of the structure continually changed. Since we decided to use the pygame library,
				our plans were based off of our understanding of that library's functionality. As we learned more about how pygame functioned, our structure
				necessarily changed as a result. We should have spend some time playing around with pygame and understanding how it operates before starting
				our development cycle. The changes to the front-end structure necessitated changes to the back-end structure and overall slowed down development.
				When we decided to use 3rd-party libraries in the future, we will spend time undergoing tutorials and tests before implementing a code structure.
			</p>
		<h3>Documentation of Code</h3>
			<p style="margin-left: 20px">Due to different autodocumentation options that are available for Python, it took sometime before we could implement
				standardized docstrings for Python. This caused to some confusion as different developers on the team interpreted code differently. This cause
				work to be repeated and methods to be implemented incorrectly. With the benefit of hindsight, we ought to have written some kind of documentation
				for functions as we developed. Then, we could have gone back and implemented the reST syntax on our documentation. In the future, our team will
				document while coding.
			</p>
		<h3>Standup Meetings</h3>
			<p style="margin-left: 20px">During the beginning of meetings, we spent some time discussing and dividing work between the group. Unfortuately,
				we then spent the remainder of meetings working without reuniting with the entire group to discuss what had been accomplished. This caused
				team members to work independently of each other and the spread of work to be uneven. We now plan on having quick standup planning session
				within our larger meetings.
