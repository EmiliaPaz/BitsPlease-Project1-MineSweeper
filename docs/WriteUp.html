<h2>Challenges Faced by the Team</h2>

<h2>What the Team Would Have Done Differently</h2>
	<div style="margin-left: 40px">
		<h3>Additional Planning to Avoid Structural Changes</h3>
			<p>As we developed the back and front ends, our vision of the structure continually changed. Since we decided to use the pygame library,
				our plans were based off of our understanding of that library's functionality. As we learned more about how pygame functioned, our structure
				necessarily changed as a result. We should have spend some time playing around with pygame and understanding how it operates before starting
				our development cycle. The changes to the front-end structure necessitated changes to the back-end structure and overall slowed down development.
				When we decided to use 3rd-party libraries in the future, we will spend time undergoing tutorials and tests before implementing a code structure.
			</p>
			<p>The other thing that we would have done differently is not save documentation until the end. We ended up writing most of the in-code documentation
					(how specific functions and variables work) until after we had almost the entire application implemented. This led to some confusion at times when differently
					group members tried to understand functions that another group member had written, as there was no explanation for how anything worked. It would have been better
					to have written at least basic documentation for each function as it was written, so other group memebers reading the code would be able to immediately know
					exactly what the function was supposed to do. In the future we would try to do a better job of writing good documentation as our program was being developed.
