Hey! Set this up so that...

1. You have a github.io page for your project that looks for an index.html in the docs folder
2. Make sure you configure sphinx as it appears in this repo
3. Make sure your Makefile builds in docs
4. Run generateDocs.sh when you are ready.
5. Go to the docs folder and move all of the files in the html folder to docs.
6. After ~1 minute, your githib.io project page should show all of the documentation!
